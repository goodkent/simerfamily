        <p>Welcome to my website dedicated to Simer Genealogy and their Kin. This site primarily focuses on the descendants of John Picklesimer and Elizabeth Love from North Carolina who would settle in southern Illinois around 1840 near the Jefferson-Marion county line. Descendants of this family have primarily ventured from Illinois into Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona; however, Simer’s can be found in nearly every state.</p>
        <p>My research began in 1993 when I was given the family pedigree hand-drawn on a 11×17″ piece of tattered ledger paper. I was 13 years old. Neatly printed next to the name of my great-great grandfather was the first clues I would receive which humbly stated “Log Cabin”. Over the years I have discovered my family and my love for history. Research has yielded sudden treasure troves, introduced me to unknown cousins, and taken me to numerous dead-ends. Research has been slow, yet has been very rewarding.  Thank you for visiting.</p>
